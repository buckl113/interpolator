# Up Next Approved

1. Finishing implementation of simple variable substitution from a data dictionary

# Under Consideration:

1. Implement a HTML Output Directory using the basic markdown parser.
2. When reading a directory need to write the output in a predictable output directory.  Should change semantic to always write file of same name as input in the specified output directory which makes output directory mandatory.
3. Modify default  input field a array to try first one path and then the next when looking up variables.
4. Add a notion to import specification such as + before actual text to allow specification of keeping path.
5. Implement file directory recursive walk for input.  Generate same output directory in the output directory.
6. Add Cache of input files read as key values.
7. Add Cache of full files plus var name segment 
8. Implement a full YAML parser for inputs.
